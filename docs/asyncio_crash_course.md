# Asynchronous Python programming

Async IO is a single-threaded, single-process design: it uses cooperative multitasking

Pythonâ€™s async model is built around concepts such as coroutines, callbacks, events, transports, protocols, and futures

A coroutine is a function that can suspend its execution before reaching return

Coroutines that contain synchronous calls block other coroutines and tasks from running

A coroutine is function declared with `async def`
- Using `await` and/or `return` creates a coroutine function. To call a coroutine function, you must `await` it to get its results
- Using `yield` creates an asynchronous generator, which you iterate over with `async for`

The keyword `await` passes function control back to the event loop -- "goto to next work item"

Using `asyncio.Queue()` allows for N-producers to add their output to M consumers

Use `create_task()` to start the execution of a coroutine object, be sure to `await` it

You can think of the Event Loop as something like a `while True` loop that monitors coroutines, taking feedback on what's idle, and looking around for things that can be executed in the meantime

Coroutines should use try/finally blocks to robustly perform clean-up logic, when caught explicitly, `asyncio.CancelledError` should be propagated to support `timeout()`

Using `sleep(0)` provides an optimized path to allow other tasks to run, useful in long-running functions to avoid blocking the event loop for the full duration of the function call

## Interesting APIs

- run()
- create_task()
- shield()
- to_thread()
- run_in_executor()
- run_coroutine_threadsafe()
- PriorityQueue()
- ~~create_subprocess_exec()~~
  - On Windows, subprocesses are provided by `ProactorEventLoop` only (default), `SelectorEventLoop` has no subprocess support
  - https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/asyncio-platforms.html#windows
  - `aiomqtt` requires `SelectorEventLoop`
- Event
- Condition
- get_running_loop()
