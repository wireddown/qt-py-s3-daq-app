# Actors

- client: publish message to server, subscribe to message topics
  - does not have an address, can self-identify in their published messages
  - does have an identifier, which it sends during connection
- server: receive messages from clients, dispatch messages to subscribers
  - creates the $SYS topic which publishes information about the broker
  - standard version uses TCP/IP on port 1883
  - if no one is subscribed to a topic, the broker discards those messages
- topic: identifier on a message to support publish/subscribe
  - structured in a hierarchy using the forward slash /
  - only exists if a client has subscribed to it, or a broker has a retained or last will messages stored for that topic

# Connectivity

- Most MQTT clients will connect to the broker and remain connected even if they aren‚Äôt sending data.
- Connections are acknowledged by the broker using a Connection acknowledgement message.
- MQTT clients publish a keep-alive message at regular intervals (usually 60 seconds) which tells the broker that the client is still connected
- If you attempt to connect to an MQTT broker with the same name as an existing client then the existing client connection is dropped.
- A client can specify a last will message for each topic from the broker to notify a subscriber that the publisher is unavailable due to network outage

## Bring-up flow

--> Connect(my_identifer)
<-- CONNACK
--> Subscribe(topic, QoS)
<-- SUBACK
--> Publish(message, topic, QoS, is_retained)
<-- PUBACK

## QoS controls whether and how messages are retained by broker for glitchy clients
- QoS 0 - Default and doesn‚Äôt guarantee message delivery.
- QoS 1 - Guarantees message delivery but could get duplicates.
- QoS 2 - Guarantees message delivery with no duplicates.

# Topic and payload design patterns

- Separate command and response topics using a prefix e.g command/ and response/
- Include routing information in the topic structure
- subscribe to all topics with '#'
- subscribe to all $SYS topics with '$SYS/#'
- Ensure MQTT topic levels structure follows a general to specific pattern. As topic scheme flows left to right, the topic levels flow general to specific.
- Include any relevant routing information in the MQTT topic. Relevant routing information includes, but is not limited to, the IoT application identifier, any groups the device may be a part of, such as installed location, and the unique identity of your IoT device.
- Prefix your MQTT topics to distinguish data topics from command topics. Make sure that your MQTT topics do not overlap between commands and data messages.
- Include additional contextual information about a specific message in the payload of the MQTT message. This contextual information includes, but is not limited to, a session identifier, the requestor identifier, logging information, or the return topic on which a device is expecting to receive a response.
- Never allow a device to subscribe to all topics using #
- MQTT topics for command requests: cmd/<application>/<context>/<destination-id>/<req-type>
- MQTT topic structure for responding to commands: cmd/<application>/<context>/<destination-id>/<res-type>
- generate a schema for message payloads
  - transaction-id -- unique for each request-response
  - response-topic
- base topic/cmnd/device_id/command
- base topic/response/device_id
- base topic/response/device_id/result
- base topic/status/device_id/state
- base topic/status/device_id/info
- base topic/connected/device_id
- protocol_prefix / src_id / dest_id / message_id / extra_properties
